# Embedded Systems Design  

## Overview  
This repository contains my lab projects, design files, and documentation from **CMPEN 472: Microprocessors and Embedded Systems** at **Penn State University**.  
The course focused on the architecture, design, and programming of **microprocessor-based embedded systems**, combining both hardware and software elements with an emphasis on real-time control environments.  

Throughout the course, I designed, built, and programmed embedded systems that integrated sensors, actuators, and wireless communication modules. Each project was developed and tested using microcontroller platforms and Linux-based development tools, following an industry-style workflow with version control, design reviews, and documentation.

## Major Project  
This project involved the design and implementation of a **microprocessor-based embedded control system** that integrated multiple real-time components. The application utilized both the **Raspberry Pi** and **Freescale/NXP HCS12(x)** microcontrollers programmed using **CodeWarrior IDE**.  

### Core Features  
- **LED Dimming via PWM:** Controlled LED brightness using hardware timers and PWM registers.  
- **DC Motor Control:** Implemented speed and direction control using H-bridge motor drivers and optocouplers.  
- **Wireless Communication:** Used UART/RS232 with a wireless modem to send and receive ASCII commands remotely.
