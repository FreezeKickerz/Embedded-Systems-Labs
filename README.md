# CMPEN 472: Microprocessors and Embedded Systems  

## Overview  
This repository contains my lab projects, design files, and documentation from **CMPEN 472: Microprocessors and Embedded Systems** at **Penn State University**.  
The course focused on the architecture, design, and programming of **microprocessor-based embedded systems**, combining both hardware and software elements with an emphasis on real-time control environments.  

Throughout the course, I designed, built, and programmed embedded systems that integrated sensors, actuators, and wireless communication modules. Each project was developed and tested using microcontroller platforms and Linux-based development tools, following an industry-style workflow with version control, design reviews, and documentation.
