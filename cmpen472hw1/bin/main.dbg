* Tyler Korz CMPEN 472
* Register use : A accumulator: character data to be filled
* 		           B accumulator: counter, number of filled locations
*		             X register: memory address pointer
*
* Memory use: RAM Locations from $3000 to $3009
*
* Input: Parameters hard coded in the program
*
* Output: Data filled in memory locations,
* from $3000 to $3009 changed
*
* Observation: This program is designed for instruction purpose.
* This program can be used as a 'loop' template
*
* Note : This is a good example of program comments
* All Homework programs MUST have comments similar
* to this Homework 1 program. So, please use this
* comment format for all your subsequent CMPEN 472
* Homework programs.
*
* Adding more explanations and comments help you and
* others to understand your program later.
*
* Comments: This program is developed and simulated using CodeWorrior
* development software.
